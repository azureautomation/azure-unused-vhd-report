Azure unused Vhd Report
=======================

            

The script will go through your Azure subscription and find all vhd’s on storage accounts. It will match those that are attached to the virtual machines. This way you can determine if you have orphaned
 vhd’s that are no longer use by virtual machine. The script report only and removal is a manual process. It can be automated, but due to the possible impact, it is up to you to automate. 


Script updated to include storage tier and Drive Size, Also a thank you to Edward Wilson for he's recommendation.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
